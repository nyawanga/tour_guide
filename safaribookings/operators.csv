An African safari is an experience unlike any other. When we plan your journey, whether you choose a pre-designed tour, join a small group, or enjoy a customized private safari – Flight & Safaris International Ltd will make sure you have the ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME... We can take you walking among the world’s greatest game herds on the plains of Masai Mara, the ‘pink’ lake-Lake Nakuru, or even the Elephant Country-Amboseli. We can look into the noble eyes of a male lion or learn the agile dances of ochre-smeared Maasai warriors, or bask in the brilliance of the greatest bird show on Earth. Nothing prepares you for the African nights. At dusk the wind dies, as whining cicadas and hidden night birds trill the first notes. A jackal wails. Other voices join in: yelps, hoots, a strangled cry. A hyena’s eerie cackle explodes into deranged shrieks in the darkness beyond camp. Shuddering, you edge closer to the campfire. So why wait? This is your only time to discover the picturesque landscapes and captivating destinations, which make each of our safaris an exceptional and distinctly African Experience. OUR SAFARIS HIGHLIGHTS: 1.
